# Payroll
C program for taking employee payroll information and saving it to both a .txt and .bin file.
This information includes employee's hourly rate, hours worked, regular and overtime pay.
Also calculations are automatically done for gross pay, net pay, federal tax deduction and
social security deduction. The user can come back to the program and add employee payroll 
records to already existing files or choose to create new ones and overwrite files.
